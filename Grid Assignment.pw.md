1. What is the grid?

answer-> The grid refers to the CSS Grid Layout, which is a powerful layout system in CSS used to create two-dimensional grid-based layouts. It allows you to create complex layouts by dividing a web page or a container into rows and columns, and then placing content (grid items) within those cells.

2. What is the difference between Flex and grid?
8
answer-> Both Flexbox and CSS Grid are layout systems in CSS, but they have different use cases and behavior:

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout):
Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, typically for arranging items in a row or a column. It provides a flexible way to distribute space among items within a container, allowing for dynamic resizing of items. It's particularly useful for building navigation bars, card layouts, and vertical/horizontal alignment of elements.

CSS Grid:
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system. It's used for creating complex layouts involving rows and columns. It allows you to define both rows and columns explicitly and position items within the grid cells. CSS Grid is well-suited for designing grid-based designs, such as magazine-style layouts, image galleries, and overall page structure.

3. How can you define rows and columns for your grid?

answer-> Defining Rows and Columns for a Grid:
You can define rows and columns for a CSS Grid using the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties, respectively. These properties accept values like lengths, percentages, and "fr" units (fractional units) to define the sizes of rows and columns. Here's an example:
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr; /* Two rows, first row is 1 fraction, second row is 2 fractions */
  grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr; /* Two columns, first column is 100px, second column is 1 fraction */
}

4. List any two properties of the grid item and grid container.

answer-> Two Properties of Grid Item and Grid Container:

Grid Container Properties:

display: This property is set to grid on the container to create a grid layout.
grid-template-rows / grid-template-columns: These properties define the rows and columns of the grid container, specifying their sizes and distribution.

Grid Item Properties:

grid-row: Specifies the placement of the grid item within rows.
grid-column: Specifies the placement of the grid item within columns.
