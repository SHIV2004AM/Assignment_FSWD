1. What are the new things introduced in HTML5?

ANSWER-> HTML5 introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessors. Some of the notable additions in HTML5 include:
Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements that provide more meaning to the structure of web pages, making it easier for search engines and screen readers to understand the content.

Audio and Video Support: HTML5 includes built-in support for embedding audio and video content without the need for plugins like Flash.

Canvas: The <canvas> element allows dynamic graphics and animations to be drawn using JavaScript.

Improved Form Elements: HTML5 introduced several new input types, such as date pickers, email fields, and range sliders, making form handling more user-friendly.

Local Storage: HTML5 provides a way to store data locally on the user's browser, even when the browser is closed, using the localStorage API.

Web Workers: HTML5 introduced the ability to run scripts in the background using web workers, enabling better performance and responsiveness.

Geolocation: HTML5 supports geolocation, allowing websites to request and access the user's geographical location.

SVG Support: HTML5 added native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), enabling the inclusion of resolution-independent graphics directly in the markup.

Responsive Web Design: HTML5 made it easier to create responsive websites with media queries and new layout elements like <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.

2. What are semantic tags? Give a couple of examples.

ANSWER-> Semantic tags in HTML are elements that carry meaning about the structure of the web page and its content, rather than just specifying the presentation or appearance. They provide a way to describe the content's purpose, making the HTML code more readable and accessible. Here are a couple of examples of semantic tags:
<header>: This tag represents the introductory content of a page or a section and typically includes the site's logo, navigation, or other heading elements.
Example:
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<article>: This tag represents a self-contained piece of content that can be distributed independently and is typically used for blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.
Example:
<article>

  <footer>Published on August 5, 2023</footer>
</article>


3. List some uses of semantic tags.

ANSWER-> Uses of semantic tags:
Accessibility: Semantic tags help screen readers and other assistive technologies to better understand the content, making websites more accessible to people with disabilities.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines use semantic tags to understand the content and context of web pages, potentially improving a website's ranking in search results.

Structured Styling: Semantic tags make it easier to apply consistent and meaningful styles across a website. For example, styling all <h1> elements as main headings or all <nav> elements as navigation bars.

Web Scraping: When websites use semantic tags, web scraping becomes more straightforward and accurate since the structure and purpose of content are clearly defined.

Interoperability: Semantic tags enable better communication between different web services, applications, and devices by providing clear content semantics.

Maintenance: Using semantic tags makes the code easier to read and understand, simplifying maintenance and updates to the website over time.
