1. What is the Internet? Explain in your own words.

ANSWER-> The Internet, in simple terms, is a vast network of interconnected computers and servers worldwide, allowing information and data to be shared and accessed across the globe. It serves as a virtual highway that enables communication, collaboration, and the exchange of various types of content, such as text, images, videos, and more. The Internet has become an essential part of modern life, facilitating services like email, social media, online shopping, and a plethora of other web-based applications.

2. What is a web browser? Explain in your own words.

ANSWER-> A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and interact with content on the Internet. It acts as a gateway between the user and the vast collection of websites and webpages available on the Internet. Users can input web addresses, known as URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), or click on hyperlinks to navigate between different websites. Web browsers render webpages, displaying the text, images, videos, and interactive elements contained in them, and they also provide tools like bookmarks, history, and extensions to enhance the browsing experience.

3. What is a browser engine? Explain in your own words.

ANSWER-> A browser engine, also known as a rendering engine or layout engine, is a critical component of a web browser. It is responsible for interpreting and displaying web content to users. When a user requests a webpage through a web browser, the browser engine retrieves the necessary files and resources from the web server. It then processes the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies used to create the page. The engine organizes the elements, applies styles, and arranges them on the screen, ensuring that the webpage appears visually as intended.

4. What is a static site? Explain in your own words.

ANSWER-> A static site refers to a type of website where the content remains fixed and unchanged, without any dynamic or interactive elements. In other words, the information presented on a static site does not depend on user input or real-time data. Each page of the website is created and stored as individual files, and when a user accesses the site, the server delivers these pre-built files directly to the user's web browser. Static sites are simple to create, load quickly, and are well-suited for displaying static information, such as portfolios, brochures, or informational websites.

5. What is a dynamic site? Explain in your own words.

ANSWER-> A dynamic site is a type of website that displays content that can change or adapt based on user interactions and real-time data. Unlike static sites, dynamic sites use server-side programming and database technologies to generate content on-the-fly. This allows for personalized user experiences, interactive features, and the ability to display up-to-date information. Dynamic sites can incorporate user logins, content management systems, search functionality, e-commerce capabilities, and more. The content and appearance of dynamic sites can vary depending on the user's preferences, actions, or the data retrieved from external sources.
