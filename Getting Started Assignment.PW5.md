1. Why do we start learning a programming language with "Hello, World!"?

ANSWER-> The "Hello, World!" program is a traditional and simple way to introduce beginners to a new programming language. It serves as a basic entry point for understanding how to write, compile, and execute code. The program typically prints the message "Hello, World!" on the screen. Starting with this program allows beginners to grasp the essential syntax and structure of the language without overwhelming them with complex concepts. It provides immediate feedback and a sense of accomplishment, which can be motivating for beginners to continue learning.

2. How is the use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?

ANSWER-> Comments in programming and markup languages like HTML are non-executable lines of text intended solely for human readers. Comments are useful for providing explanations, documenting code, or temporarily disabling certain parts of the code without deleting them entirely.

In HTML, comments are written using the following syntax:
<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->

3. What are elements, tags, and attributes, and the difference between them

ANSWER-> In the context of HTML:
Elements: HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. They define the structure and content of a document. Each element is represented by a tag and may contain other elements, text, or multimedia content.

Tags: HTML tags are used to define elements and indicate how they should be displayed on a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). They usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the element's name, and the closing tag has a forward slash (/) before the element name.

Attributes: HTML attributes provide additional information about an HTML element. They are specified within the opening tag and help modify the behavior or appearance of the element. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.


4. Briefly explain what HTML entities are.

ANSWER-> HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have special meanings in HTML or that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard. For instance, characters like "<" and ">" are used for HTML tags, so if you want to display them as regular text, you would use their respective HTML entities: &lt; for "<" and &gt; for ">".
Some common HTML entities include:

&lt; for "<"
&gt; for ">"
&amp; for "&"
&quot; for double quotation marks (")
&apos; for single quotation marks (')
&nbsp; for a non-breaking space
Using HTML entities ensures that special characters are displayed correctly in web pages and helps avoid conflicts with HTML syntax.
