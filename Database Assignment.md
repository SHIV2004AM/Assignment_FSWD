   - A database is a structured collection of data organized to facilitate efficient retrieval, management, and updating of information. It uses a database management system (DBMS) to store, organize, and manage data. 

   Example: Consider a company that needs to store information about its employees, such as names, salaries, and departments. Instead of using separate files for each employee, a database can be used to organize and efficiently retrieve this information.

2. Write a short note on File-Based Storage System. Explain the major challenges of a File-Based Storage System.
   - File-based storage systems involve storing data in individual files. Major challenges include lack of data integrity, data redundancy, and difficulty in data sharing among different applications.

3. What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?
   - DBMS stands for Database Management System. The need for DBMS arises from the limitations of file-based systems. DBMS provides a centralized and structured approach to managing data, ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient data retrieval.

4. Explain challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS.
   - Challenges of file-based systems include data redundancy, inconsistency, and difficulty in data retrieval. DBMS addresses these challenges by providing a centralized and organized structure, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating efficient data management.

5. List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.
   - Database classification includes hierarchical, network, relational, and object-oriented databases. Each type has its own structure and methods for organizing and retrieving data.

6. What is the significance of Data Modeling? Explain the types of data modeling.
   - Data modeling is crucial for designing and representing data structures in a database. It helps in understanding and visualizing the relationships between different data entities. Types of data modeling include conceptual, logical, and physical modeling.

7. Explain 3-schema architecture along with its advantages.
   - The three-schema architecture separates the database into three levels: user, logical, and physical. This separation provides flexibility, security, and ease of maintenance. The user schema deals with how data is presented to users, the logical schema defines the logical structure of the data, and the physical schema defines how data is stored and accessed at the physical level.
