1. What is HTML?

ANSWER-> HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is a standard markup language used for creating and structuring the content of websites. It provides a way to organize text, images, multimedia, and other elements into a coherent structure that can be rendered by web browsers. HTML uses tags and attributes to define the various components of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. It forms the backbone of most web pages and works in conjunction with other technologies like CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive web experiences.

2. What is CSS?

ANSWER-> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows web developers to define the appearance of elements on a web page, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. By separating the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), developers can apply consistent styles across multiple pages and make global changes more efficiently. CSS works by applying rules and styles to HTML elements, either directly within the HTML document or through external style sheets.


3. Why did JavaScript come into the picture?

ANSWER-> JavaScript: JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. Unlike HTML and CSS, which are primarily used for structuring and styling web content, JavaScript enables developers to create interactive features like forms, animations, image sliders, and more. With JavaScript, web pages can respond to user interactions, update content dynamically, and communicate with web servers without requiring a full page refresh. This capability significantly enhances the user experience and allows the development of complex web applications.

4. History of JavaScript and EcmaScript. Explain in your own words.

ANSWER-> History of JavaScript and EcmaScript:

JavaScript's Origins: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich, a programmer working at Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995. Initially called "Mocha" and later "LiveScript," it was designed as a lightweight scripting language for Netscape's web browser, Navigator. Eventually, due to the popularity of Java at the time, it was renamed "JavaScript" to leverage the Java brand.

Standardization Efforts: As JavaScript gained traction, other browser vendors started implementing their versions, leading to inconsistencies and compatibility issues. To address this, Netscape collaborated with Ecma International to standardize the language, resulting in the first edition of ECMAScript (ES1) in 1997. ECMAScript is the official name for the standard on which JavaScript is based.

ES2 and ES3: In 1998, ES2 was released, bringing some improvements to the language, but it wasn't widely adopted. However, ES3, released in 1999, became the first version of ECMAScript to be widely supported across major browsers. It introduced features that many developers still used for a long time, but it lacked some essential functionalities.

Rise of AJAX: In the mid-2000s, a technique called AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) gained popularity. It allowed web pages to fetch and update data from the server without reloading the whole page. This, along with the advent of more sophisticated web applications, increased the demand for more powerful and efficient JavaScript.

ES5: In 2009, ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was released, bringing significant improvements to the language, including support for JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), strict mode, and more advanced functions like map, reduce, and forEach. ES5 played a crucial role in the modernization of JavaScript.

ES6 (ES2015) and Beyond: The most significant leap in ECMAScript's history came with ES6, officially known as ECMAScript 2015, released in 2015. ES6 introduced a plethora of new features, such as classes, arrow functions, let and const variables, template literals, and enhanced object literals. Since then, ECMAScript has followed a yearly release cycle, with new versions adding even more features and improvements.

Ongoing Development: JavaScript continues to evolve with regular ECMAScript updates, bringing modern language features and improved developer experiences. Each new ECMAScript version includes proposals that go through a rigorous process, involving developers, browser vendors, and the ECMAScript committee, to ensure stability and backward compatibility.
