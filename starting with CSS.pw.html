1. What is CSS and why use it?

answer-> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS is used to control how elements of a web page are displayed, including their layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects. It separates the content (HTML) of a web page from its presentation, making it easier to manage and maintain the design and layout of a website. CSS allows for consistent styling across multiple web pages and devices, making websites more visually appealing, user-friendly, and adaptable to different screen sizes and orientations.

2. What are the different ways to bring CSS into an HTML file?

answer-> There are several ways to include CSS styles in an HTML file:

Inline CSS: You can apply styles directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. For example:
<p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>

Internal CSS: You can embed CSS styles within a <style> element in the HTML <head> section. This style will apply to elements within that HTML document only.
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
External CSS: Create a separate CSS file with .css extension and link it to the HTML document using the <link> element in the <head> section.
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
      </head>
CSS Frameworks and Libraries: Utilize pre-designed CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or libraries like FontAwesome that provide a collection of styles and components to enhance your website's design and functionality.

3. What do you mean by specificity in CSS?

answer-> Specificity in CSS:
Specificity refers to the rules that determine which CSS styles should be applied to an HTML element when multiple conflicting styles are defined. It's a measure of how specific a selector is in targeting an element. When there are conflicting styles, the browser needs to decide which style should take precedence.

Specificity is calculated based on the combination of selectors used in a CSS rule. In general, the more specific a selector is, the higher its specificity. For example:

Inline styles have the highest specificity.
ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors.
Class selectors have higher specificity than tag selectors.

To calculate specificity, you assign weights to different parts of a selector:

1 specificity point for each ID selector
1 specificity point for each class or attribute selector
1 specificity point for each element selector
So, a selector like #header .nav ul li.active would have a higher specificity than body p.

When conflicting styles exist, the style with higher specificity will be applied. If two styles have equal specificity, the one defined later in the stylesheet takes precedence (CSS rule ordering).

Understanding specificity helps developers control and predict how styles will be applied, ensuring consistent and expected design outcomes.
